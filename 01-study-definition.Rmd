# Study definition

## Reproducibile dummy data

- To ensure the dummy data system generates exactly the same data every time you run it, set a random number generator seed at the top of the `study_definition.py` file

    ``` python
    import numpy as np
    np.random.seed(123456) # change this number to one for which your scripts successfully run on the dummy data
    ```

## File formats

- Use `.feather` files for outputs from the cohortextractor, so specify an action in your `project.yaml` as follows

    ``` yaml
    generate_study_population:
      run: cohortextractor:latest generate_cohort --study-definition study_definition --output-format feather
     needs: 
      - design
      outputs:
        highly_sensitive:
          cohort: output/input.feather
    ```  
- Use the **arrow** package to read `.feather` files into R 
  
    ``` r
    arrow::read_feather(file = file.path("output", "input.feather"))
    ```  
  - The `col_select` argument can be used to read in just the columns you need   

- Start each project with a preprocessing action that formats `.feather` files and outputs (gzipped) `.rds` files which can be saved with `readr::write_rds()`
  
    ``` r
    readr::write_rds(object, file.path("output", "mydata.rds"), compress = "gz")
    ```
