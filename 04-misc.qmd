# Miscellaneous

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center")
```

## Text files

- Text files should end with a newline character (i.e., a blank line)
  - If you see the following red icon at the end of a file on GitHub, simply press <kbd>`r knitr::asis_output('\U21B5')`&nbsp;Enter</kbd> at the end of the file (i.e., in this case after the word *Catalog*), resave, commit, and the red icon should be gone  
    ```{r, out.width="100%"}
    knitr::include_graphics("img/endoffile-newline-missing.png")
    ```  

## Python and R versions

- The versions of Python and R in their respective OpenSAFELY Docker containers are (as of 15<sup>th</sup> February 2023):
  - Python 3.8.10
  - R 4.0.5 (was R 4.0.2 upto and including 15/02/2023)
- The Python and R code run within their respective Docker containers. Hence the version of Python and R used to run your analyses are the versions of Python and R in these Docker containers and *not* the versions of Python and R on your computer

- To see the Python version number insert in your `study_definition.py`
  
  ``` python
  import sys
  print(sys.implementation.version)
  ```  
- To see the R version number insert into one of your R analysis scripts  
  
  ``` r
  print(R.version.string)
  ```
