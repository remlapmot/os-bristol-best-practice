# Rosetta for Linux Docker feature on Apple Silicon Macs

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center")
```

If you have an Apple Silicon Mac if you enable the Rosetta for Linux beta feature in Docker the OpenSAFELY Docker containers will run faster on your machine.

To enable this 

* Make sure you have Docker version 4.16.0 or higher installed
* Open the Docker dashboard and go into Settings (click the cog icon in top right hand corner)
* Go to *Features in development* and within that the *Beta features tab*
* Check the box for *Use Rosetta for x86/amd64 emulation on Apple Silicon*
* Click *Apply & restart*
