- Python and R versions
  - The versions of Python and R in their respective OpenSAFELY Docker containers are (as of 1<sup>st</sup> December 2021):
    - Python 3.8.10
    - R 4.0.2
  - The Python and R code run within their respective Docker containers. Hence the version of Python and R used to run your analyses are the versions of Python and R in these Docker containers and *not* the versions of Python and R on your computer
  - To see the Python version number insert in your `study_definition.py`
  
    ``` python
    import sys
    print(sys.implementation.version)
    ```  
  - To see the R version number insert into one of your R analysis scripts  
  
    ``` r
    print(R.version.string)
    ```
